1. Login screen  
- error handling  
- username 401 alert  
- username 500 redirect to ugly page  
- to login use any other username, pass not required  
2. collapsable menu  
- folds to icons  
- pushes main content forth when open and back when closed  
- animation for menu items when folding/unfolding  
- arrow-like button below menu items for sliding menu  
- two-way arrow for open and closed menu  
- links to different views, content displayed in main area, no modals  
- more modularity :)
